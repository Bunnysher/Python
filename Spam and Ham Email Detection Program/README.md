# Reversi in Java


**Objective**:  
This program filters emails and determines if they are malicious (spam) or safe (ham) by implementing the Naive Bayes Classifier. The alogirthm has been trained and tested using the Ling - Spam data.

**Structure of the code**:  
By calculating the word frequency in ham and spam emails of the training datasets we are able to determine if a new email should be classified as a spam or as a ham based on the words it contains. Program offers user the flexibility to choose between two methods: a) the Naive Bayes Classifier and b) the Naive Bayes Classifier which also incorporates the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) method.
